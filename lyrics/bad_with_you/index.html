        <p>You came on slow</p>
        <p>Like shadows on a Summer evening</p>
        <p>Soft and low</p>
        <p>While I was growing into what you needed</p>
        <p>Now I know</p>
        <p>Summers go; baby I ain't leaving</p>
        <p>Where you go is where I go</p>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>I only want to be bad with you</p>
        <p>Only want it like that with you</p>
        <p>Don't want to be stumbling home when it's 6 in the morning</p>
        <p>With somebody new</p>
        <p>I only want to be bad, bad, bad with you</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>I said it first...</p>
        <p>Now I'm crying at the bar again</p>
        <p>Choking on my words</p>
        <p>Promise that I am gonna be the man</p>
        <p>That you deserve</p>
        <p>It's the same old whiskey, just a different city</p>
        <p>And I never learn</p>
        <p>Will I ever learn?</p>

        <p>I only want to be bad, bad, bad with you</p>
        <p>Only want the butterflies with you</p>
        <p>Only want to take my time with you</p>
        <p>Only want to be losing sleep, can't think, can't eat</p>
        <p>If it's all 'cause of you</p>
        <p>I only want to be bad, bad, bad with you</p>

        <p>We've got a good thing going, don't we</p>
