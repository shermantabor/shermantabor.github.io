        <p>My love is beautiful</p>
        <p>She planted roses in Spring</p>
        <p>Told me when it's colder</p>
        <p>She'd be waiting for me</p>
        <p>Where'd you go?</p>
        <p>Where'd you go?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>Colorful, she set a fire in me</p>
        <p>Told me when I left her</p>
        <p>She'd forgive everything</p>
        <p>Should've known</p>
        <p>Should've known</p>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>And I left you in silence</p>
        <p>With the lies that I told</p>
        <p>Darling, did you like them?</p>
        <p>'Cause I meant them all</p>

        <p>It don't take no love to give up</p>
        <p>It don't take no love to leave somebody in the dust</p>
        <p>It don't take no courage to play a game that you can't lose</p>
        <p>Did I take you for a fool?</p>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>Undeniable, we ain't like nobody before</p>
        <p>A hundred miles an hour</p>
        <p>Down these midnight roads</p>
        <p>Where'd you go?</p>
        <p>Where'd you go?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>Prideful, I've never felt so alone</p>
        <p>Ran away from the high</p>
        <p>'Cause I'm afraid of the low</p>
        <p>Let you go</p>
        <p>Let you go</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>And now we're standing at the corner</p>
        <p>We're both losing a lover</p>
        <p>'Cause I can't take the heat</p>
        <p>And you were under cover</p>
        <p>Can't believe this is how it goes</p>
        <p>Your picture still hangs on my wall</p>
