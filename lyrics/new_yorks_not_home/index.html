        <p>Everything looks better when you're looking back</p>
        <p>23, damn it feels like that</p>
        <p>Strange city of blank stares and nomads</p>
        <p></p>
    </div>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>Weekend love</p>
        <p>Two cities when Sunday comes</p>
        <p>You'll take the train and I'll keep your stuff</p>
        <p>In a drawer until you come back up</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>You laugh 'cause you're surprised when I tell you</p>
        <p>I'm a little insecure with my feelings</p>
        <p>I never had much luck</p>
        <p>When I played the tough guy</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>You say all your goodbyes</p>
        <p>And time won't fly</p>
        <p>Enterain myself with liquor and lies</p>
        <p>And hope that I'll be on your mind</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>And it's way too cold</p>
        <p>In the city in December alone</p>
        <p>And I need to know</p>
        <p>Am I everything that you're thinking of?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>Last night we ran through the lights like running home</p>
        <p>Today I'll walk the same city alone</p>
        <p>Last night I thought I might never let you go again</p>
        <p>Today you're not in New York, so New York's not home</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>Everything looks better when you're looking back</p>
        <p>But I don't want to live like that</p>
        <p>I don't want to be sad, so I won't be sad</p>
        <p></p>
    </div>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>I look from your left eye to the right</p>
        <p>'Cause I'm too close to see them at the same time</p>
        <p>You kept all your cards close to your chest</p>
        <p>I never really knew how to do that, did I?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>I'm in the city</p>
        <p>In December alone</p>
        <p>And, baby, I don't know</p>
        <p>How all this distance somehow made us so close</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>Last night we danced on the west side in the snow</p>
        <p>Today I'll listen to the music alone</p>
        <p>Last night I thought I might never let you go again</p>
        <p>Today you're not in New York, and I'm on my own</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>Last night we snuck into the park at 4 AM</p>
        <p>Today I'll sit on the benches alone</p>
        <p>Last night I thought I might never let you go again</p>
        <p>Today you're not in New York, so New York's not home</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>So many faces</p>
        <p>I keep hoping one of them's yours</p>
        <p>Of all the places</p>
        <p>I don't know why you're not in New York</p>
        <p>And I've been chasing you</p>
        <p>So long and way too far</p>
        <p>But you're not in New York</p>
        <p>And it breaks my heart</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>Last night we watched the sunset over cityscapes</p>
        <p>Today I'll watch it come back up alone</p>
        <p>Last night I thought I might never let you go again</p>
        <p>Today you're not in New York, so New York's not home</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>Last night I let my heart slip out of my lips</p>
        <p>Today you'll tell me you're glad that I did</p>
        <p>Last night I thought I might never let you go again</p>
        <p>Today you're not in New York, and I can't stand it</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>Everything used to look better when I looked back</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>Everything used to look better when I looked back</p>
        <p>'Til you came along and stopped me in my tracks</p>
        <p>Now I just look at you</p>
        <p>I don't look back</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>Now everything looks like a blur when I look back</p>
        <p>Your love, it stops me in my tracks</p>
        <p>Now I just look at you</p>
        <p>No looking back</p>
    </div>
