        <p>Call me a loser, call me a con</p>
        <p>I've been stuck in the past since I had one</p>
        <p>Only see green in fields I've already walked</p>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>Not one word, never out loud</p>
        <p>Don't even know what it would sound like now</p>

        <p>I went down to the water</p>
        <p>Climbed the magnlias</p>
        <p>I'm a high school hero</p>
        <p>I can see it all up here</p>
        <p>I wonder are you doing better</p>
        <p>In your high heels you love</p>
        <p>Dancing in my rearview</p>

    <div class="lyrics-block">
        <p>I got a little older, not much wiser</p>
        <p>But I'm still growing; I'm still trying</p>
        <p>But double dares and pinky swears</p>
        <p>Made fools of us, dear</p>
        <p>These games are just for kids who want to get played</p>

        <p>I know it's been a few years</p>
        <p>And it probably never crosses your mind</p>
        <p>I always had to leave</p>
        <p>But I never meant to leave you behind</p>
        <p>And I know I should've called</p>
        <p>But I never could call it goodbye</p>
        <p>And it's been a few years</p>
        <p>I just hope that you're doing alright</p>

        <p>Lost is the boy who never grows up</p>
        <p>Wide is the city, driving alone</p>
        <p>The shipwreck sank below</p>
        <p>But I just wanted you to know</p>
        <p>Heavy is the heart that can't let go</p>
        <p>Empty is the hand that spends all your love</p>
        <p>Time has healed this wound</p>
        <p>But darling, you were my darkest blue</p>
